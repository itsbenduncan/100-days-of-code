### Day 0: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a python script that calls API data from free weather service, then processes the JSON, and tweets out local weather using tweepy. 

**Thoughts:** It was a fairly easy process. Used twitter dev tools for the first time. I think tomorrow, if i can find it, I will set up the raspberry pi as a server so the script can run continuously.
