### Day 1: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a python script that calls API data from free weather service, then processes the JSON, and tweets out local weather using tweepy. 

**Thoughts:** It was a fairly easy process. Used twitter dev tools for the first time. I think tomorrow, if i can find it, I will set up the raspberry pi as a server so the script can run continuously.

### Day 2: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the twitter weather bot and got it running with intended weather data. It now pulls noaa weather data and tweets it hourly. Also got my raspberry pi up and running with remote connection. It now continuously runs the twitter weather bot.  

**Thoughts:** It was a lot of fun getting the raspberry pi going. Also feeling much better about the codebase for itsweatherbot. I think there are definitely more projects to come for the raspberry pi. Potentially an instagram bot next?

### Day 3: April 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to move onto something totally new for day 3. SVGs! It was a lot of document reading mixed with trial and error (no videos or tutorials), so there no finished project to show for the day. 

**Thoughts:** The beziar curves took a some time to work with but I like SVG work and will definitely do more.

### Day 4: April 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was practice practice practice with SVGs and I have something finished! I recreated the NASA worm logo and it's now saved on codepen.

**Thoughts:** It took a little longer than I was expecting to finish this project. I also created a set pixel svg at the start so it doesn't resize which is an issue. Definitely want to spend another day in the future diving deeper with SVGs to create more accessible final projects.
